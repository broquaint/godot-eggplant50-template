# Drop Walker

Created for Eggplant50.

Walk around a world and drop down to lower worlds to find a treat. Place boards
to cross over holes, but you can't pick them up! You only have 3 boards.

Inspired by [this tweet from
PapilloteContet](https://twitter.com/PapilloteContet/status/1755192182104097090).
I implemented the rules that I imagined worked for their puzzle.
